# Football Leaks - Stage 1

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of the case and describes the first assignment. This stage will help
you gain hands-on experience on file forensics and steganalysis, and it requires the examination of a
small number of files which can be found in the `Artifacts` folder. 

To analyze these artifacts, you may use the Kali Linux distribution or the Parrot OS idstribution on a forensically sound virtual machine.


## Scenario presentation

Charles Daniels is an investigative reporter that is famous for breaking controversial stories on sports.
Recently, he made a post on his blog claiming that Levy Fran Velucci has been involved in a fraudulent
transaction of James Santos, a rising star football player that was transferred to Red Hawks Football Club
in the last season. 

Mr. Velucci has been the president of the club for nearly 20 years. In his blog post,
Mr. Daniels claims to have documentation in his possession proving that Mr. Velucci has financially
damaged the club in said transfer by diverting 3 million euro worth into his bank account.

This blog post caught the attention of a prosecuting attorney who has been
investigating Mr. Velucci for several years now as a suspect for several crimes of embezzlement against
the club. 

In an attempt to follow this new lead, the prosecuting attorney obtained a warrant and instructed
the police authorities to search Mr. Daniels’ household to look for potentially incriminating documents
and tracing their source. The police authorities followed suit and started an investigation. You were hired
to lead the forensic task force looking for relevant digital evidence.

The first responding officer found several pieces of equipment in Mr. Daniels’ residence, amongst
which a pen drive. The following files were extracted from this pen drive (these files can be found in the `Artifacts` folder)
